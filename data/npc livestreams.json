    "analysis": "The 'npc livestreams' trend appears to be relatively new and not yet widely adopted. The lack of social media engagement and flat Google Trends interest suggest it has not gained significant mainstream traction. This trend likely involves individuals or groups streaming content while portraying themselves as 'non-player characters' (NPCs) from video games or other fictional worlds, potentially for entertainment or commentary purposes.",
