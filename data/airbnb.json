    "analysis": "The trend for Airbnb appears to be relatively flat, with a Google interest score of 78. However, the social media presence of the brand is high, especially on TikTok and Instagram. While the momentum is at 0%, the token information provided suggests a reasonable level of liquidity, indicating a potentially active market. Overall, the data suggests a stable and popular brand with a strong social media presence, but limited momentum in the short-term.",
