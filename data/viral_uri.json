    "analysis": "The trend for 'viral uri' appears to be flat based on the Google search interest score, indicating a lack of significant growth in search volume. The social media data shows high engagement on TikTok and Instagram, suggesting a potentially viral online presence. However, the momentum metric of 0% indicates no recent momentum in the trend. The token 'ViralCoinApp' (VIRAL) is on the Solana blockchain, with a relatively low liquidity of $33,028.14, which may limit its relevance to the overall trend.",
