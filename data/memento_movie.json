    "analysis": "The movie Memento has a rising trend with high interest and engagement on social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram. However, the Momentum score is 0%, indicating a lack of recent growth in the trend. The token 'DEXTF' is related to the movie, but its low liquidity of $278,445.99 suggests it may not be a highly relevant or active token in the market.",
