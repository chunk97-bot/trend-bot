    "analysis": "The trend for 'viral christmas tree' is currently flat, indicating no significant change in interest over time. Social media engagement is high on TikTok and high on other platforms, suggesting potential virality. However, the momentum is at 0%, indicating no recent growth. The provided token, 'ViralCoinApp', is listed on Solana with a relatively low liquidity of $32,787.16, which may not be sufficient to support a highly viral trend.",
    "status": "Neutral",
    "meme": "A 'viral christmas tree' could potentially be a fun and engaging meme, especially given the high social media engagement. However, the lack of momentum and low token liquidity may limit its ability to truly go viral.",
    "token_relevant": "The 'ViralCoinApp' token may not be directly relevant to the 'viral christmas tree' trend, as it lacks the necessary liquidity and growth to effectively capitalize on the potential virality. A more liquid and actively traded token would be more suitable to support a highly viral meme."
