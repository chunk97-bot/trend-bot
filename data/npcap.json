    "analysis": "The trend for 'npcap' appears to be flat, with a Google interest score of 0 and no significant momentum. The social media presence is high across platforms like TikTok and Instagram, indicating strong online engagement. The Lobster Language Model (LLM) token has a relatively low liquidity of $3,963.81 on the Solana blockchain, suggesting it may not be a widely traded or popular token at the moment.",
    "status": "neutral",
    "meme": "The high social media presence and flat trend could indicate a potential meme-worthy opportunity, but the low token liquidity suggests it may not have gained significant traction yet.",
    "token_relevant": "The Lobster Language Model (LLM) token is not directly relevant to the 'npcap' trend, as it appears to be a separate token on the Solana blockchain. The low liquidity of the LLM token indicates it may not be a major factor in the analysis of the 'npcap' trend."
